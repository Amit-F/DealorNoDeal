# DealorNoDeal

    Welcome to my version of the hit TV show Deal or No Deal!
    In order to get started, all you have to do is hit run!
    A skippable prompt will appear at the start in order to explain the game if you deem necessary.
    In order to speed up the printing of the text, lower the delay parameter in the last method, and rerun the program.
    My recommendation is to set the delay to around 40, but if you are growing impatient or are short on time
    you are welcome to tune it down all the way to 0.
    Enjoy!
